Subject rangers/merc~
Text
what is the point of having rangers/mercenarys?
Thieves have more hp, better bs percentage, sneak
and why would any merc wanna use bash when they can
bs/flee? I think these 2 classes need to be tweaked
just a tad... like remade or something =) heheh
Just my opinion... plus no one who plays here actually
uses real warrior classes... except maybe knight might be
kinda useful... ok, that's all for today =b

Text
do you think monks should get some form of good offensive
spell to help them and a lil more hp? just a thought considering
they have no spells/special skills.. how bout' a "pinch
nerves" skill that makes it so the person drops their weapons
and can't cast spells (or just the latter) for 2 rounds, sorta
like a spell bash?

it seems to me like the mud can't handle 2 druids at once in a war...
twice when another druid and me were fighting and casting sunrays,
the mud crashed...
coincidence???

Text
i changed the way stabbers are determined by the game
can backstab with short swords now, so can 
theoretically backstab with slashing weapon (if someone
set a shortsword to slashing)

Subject survey damage reporting~
Text
it has been improved for spells, you can see what type
of damage spells do.. ie:
[Borlak:777h 500m]vs[Dude:9682h 400m]: Borlak does 36 points of electric damage to Dude with lightning bolt.

reflect spell wont reflect any "mystical" damage spells. like tornado :)

Subject new class~
Text
well since rip wont let people wiht kills of less than 50 post notes
then you can have this class Borlak =)
names sucks oh well think of a new one, Gemeter
a person in control of the elements, he would have defensive skills such as
protection from acid, fire, earth, lightening, and so on
he would also have offensive skills such as earth quake, create firestorm, firebrush, entangle,
i have many more ideas on the elemental class, if your interested. let me know
you could even also make it depend on what terrin hes on depending on what he casts

i don't think this mud can handle too many elementals from
1 conjurer
also if too many druids on.. sunrays/tornados can crash mud
too
